				<p>Due to the size of the wedding, we have not anticipated the need to reserve a hotel room block.  We personally recommend using AirBnB to book a room in Jersey City or Hoboken, NJ. They are quite affordable and will be close to the venue.

Keep in mind costs and availability may be better the further in advance you book.
